# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System API

This project is a FastAPI-based backend for a Movie Recommendation System. It provides REST API endpoints that generate personalized movie recommendations based on a user's ID and viewing context.

---

# Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have:

- Python 3.10 or above
- pip (Python package manager)

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or install manually:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic torch pandas scikit-learn
```

---

# Running the Project

Open a terminal in the project's root directory and run:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

If the server starts successfully, you should see:

```
Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### Swagger API Documentation

# Using the Recommendation Endpoint

1. Open **/docs**
2. Expand the **POST /recommend** endpoint.
3. Click **Try it out**.
4. Enter the required JSON request.
5. Click **Execute**.
6. The API will return the recommended movies in JSON format.

# Request Body Format

Example:

```json
{
  "user_id": 32,
  "context": 2
}
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| user_id | Unique ID of the user for whom recommendations will be generated. |
| context | Represents the viewing context (time of day). |

---

# Context Values

The `context` field only accepts the following numeric values:

| Time Context | Value |
|--------------|------:|
| Morning 🌅 | 0 |
| Evening 🌇 | 1 |
| Night 🌙 | 2 |

Example:

```json
{
  "user_id": 15,
  "context": 0
}
```

This generates recommendations for **User 15** during the **Morning**.

---

# Important Note

Only the following context values are valid:

- `0` → Morning 🌅
- `1` → Evening 🌇
- `2` → Night 🌙

Using any other value (such as `3`, `4`, etc.) is not supported and may produce incorrect results or cause an error.

# Example Response
